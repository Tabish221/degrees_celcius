            <h4 class="fs-lg1">PERSONALITY</h4>
            <p class="fs-p4">Kelvin is a quiet, timid and introverted man who tries to maintain a calm and professional demeanor. He tends to do as he's told by those of higher status than him and doesn't like to get in trouble. When a woman with a low score asks for his help to get on a train, Kelvin refuses to do so in fear that helping somebody with a low score will get him into trouble. Despite this however Kelvin often does illegal acts in secrecy when he thinks nobody is aware of what he's doing, such as when Shibana catches him listening to Mozart, an illegal song that can reduce the score of anyone who listens to it. Or when he uses a signal disruptor to hack into the prime minister's internet to listen to more illegal music. Even when Kelvin is caught doing things he shouldn't, Kelvin is willing to resort to bribery inorder to get away with his crimes.</p>
            <p class="fs-p4">Kelvin also seems to be dependent on drugs, mainly Neurotransmitters which he described as helping him focus. He blamed being unable to take his medication as a reason for getting distracted while at work.</p>


            <h4 class="fs-lg1">Abilities</h4>
            <p class="fs-p4">
               <b>Technology Expert : </b> Kelvin is an expert with computers and robotics and enjoys tinkering with them in his spare time. It was mentioned by his boss that in the past Kelvin was able to fix one of the company's computers before anyone from the repairs department had even showed up, earning Kelvin a promotion at his job. Upon taking apart Shibana's signal disruptor Kelvin was immediately able to recognise what it was and how it functioned. He was also able to take the device apart and install some of the pieces into his phone which allowed him to hack into the Prime Minister's private internet with ease.
            </p>

            <h4 class="fs-lg1">RELATIONSHIPS</h4>
            <p class="fs-p4">
               <b>Liam : </b> Liam is Kelvin's boss and is the manager at the factory he works at. Unlike his supervisor Alonza, Liam appears to be more respectful and understanding of Kelvin, willing to give Kelvin second chances and even an opportunity to be promoted. <br><br>
               <b>Alonza : </b> Alonza is Kelvin's supervisor. She is rude and cruel towards him and is quick to scorn him for getting distracted at work. During the meeting at Liam’s office she claims that his score should be reduced or that he should be sent to Re-Education. <br><br>
               <b>Shibana : </b> Shibana is a stranger who takes interest in Kelvin after witnessing Kelvin display unusual behavior. The two share a mutual love of classical music and Shibana appears to try and give Kelvin advice and show Kelvin a new perspective on the world however Kelvin appears to be mostly afraid of and confused by him.
